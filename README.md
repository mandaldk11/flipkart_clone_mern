<!-- # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->

Shopping Cart: A fully functional shopping cart allows users to add products, update quantities, and remove items before making a purchase.

Checkout Process: Users can proceed to the checkout page, enter shipping details, and complete the purchase.

Order History: Registered users have access to their order history, where they can track their previous purchases.

Admin Panel: An admin panel allows administrators to manage products, categories, and user orders.

Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js for building the user interface.
Backend: Node.js and Express.js to create a robust server.
